Andre I
Agassi I
escaped O
disaster O
on O
Thursday O
but O
Wimbledon I
finalist O
MaliVai I
Washington I
and O
Marcelo I
Rios I
were O
not O
so O
fortunate O
on O
a O
night O
of O
upsets O
at O
the O
U.S. I
Open I
. O

The O
11th-seeded O
Washington I
fell O
short O
of O
reprising O
his O
Wimbledon I
miracle O
comeback O
as O
he O
lost O
to O
red-hot O
wildcard O
Alex I
O'Brien I
6-3 O
6-4 O
5-7 O
3-6 O
6-3 O
in O
a O
two O
hour O
51 O
minute O
struggle O
on O
the O
Stadium O
court O
. O

Next O
door O
on O
the O
grandstand O
, O
10th O
seed O
Rios I
lost O
to O
another O
player O

a O
Wimbledon I
connection O

bad O
boy O
Jeff I

. O

The O
temperamental O
left-hander O
defeated O
the O
Chilean I
6-4 O
4-6 O
7-6 O
6-2 O
. O

The O
day O
programme O
went O
smoothly O
although O
sixth-seeded O
former O
champion O
Agassi I
had O
to O
wriggle O
out O
of O
a O
dangerous O
3-6 O
0-4 O
hole O
, O
winning O
18 O
of O
the O
last O
19 O
games O
against O
India I
's O
Leander I
Paes I
. O

But O
the O
night O
belonged O
to O
the O
upstarts O
. O

Washington I
, O
who O
climbed O
back O
from O
a O
1-5 O
deficit O
, O
two O
sets O
down O
in O
the O
third O
set O
against O
Todd I
Martin I
in O
the O
Wimbledon I
semifinals O
, O
looked O
poised O
for O
another O
sensational O
comeback O
. O

O'Brien I
, O
a O
winner O
two O
weeks O
ago O
in O
New I
Haven I
for O
his O
first O
pro O
title O
, O
served O
for O
the O
match O
at O
5-4 O
in O
the O
third O
set O
before O
Washington I
came O
charging O
back O
. O

" O
I O
just O
kept O
saying O
to O
myself O
, O
' O
keep O
giving O
yourself O
the O
best O
chance O
to O
win O
, O
keep O
battling O
, O
maybe O
something O
will O
happen O
, O
' O
" O
said O
the O
26-year-old O
O'Brien I
, O
ranked O
65th O
. O

" O
I O
kept O
my O
composure O
and O
I O
was O
proud O
of O
myself O
for O
that O
-- O
usually O
I O
would O
have O
folded O
up O
the O
tent O
and O
gone O
home O
. O
" O

The O
hard-serving O
O'Brien I
, O
a O
former O
U.S. I
collegiate O
national O
champion O
, O
fired O
up O
17 O
aces O
to O
ultimately O
subdue O
the O
never-say-die O
Washington I
. O

The O
fifth O
set O
stayed O
on O
serve O
until O
the O
sixth O
game O
, O
when O
Washington I
, O
after O
saving O
one O
break O
point O
with O
a O
forehand O
winner O
down O
the O
line O
, O
netted O
a O
backhand O
to O
give O
O'Brien I
a O
4-2 O
lead O
. O

The O
Texan I
blasted O
in O
two O
aces O
to O
hold O
serve O
at O
5-2 O
and O
then O
converted O
his O
eighth O
match O
point O
for O
victory O
when O
Washington I
found O
the O
net O
with O
another O
backhand O
from O
40-0 O
. O

" O
You O
just O
kind O
of O
keep O
fighting O
and O
you O
keep O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
play O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

I O
think O
he O
got O
a O
little O
tight O
at O
a O
couple O
of O
moments O
, O
" O
said O
Washington I
. O
" O

But O
I O
think O
he O
served O
pretty O
well O
when O
he O
had O
to O
. O
" O

Tarango I
, O
whose O
Wimbledon I
tantrum O
two O
years O
ago O
brought O
him O
a O
$ O
28,000 O
fine O
and O
suspension O
from O
this O
year O
's O
tournament O
at O
the O
All-England I
Club I
, O
argued O
calls O
and O
taunted O
fans O
in O
his O
lively O
two O
hour O
, O
24 O
minute O
tango O
with O
Rios I
on O
the O
grandstand O
. O

A O
boisterous O
cheering O
section O
backed O
the O
distracted O
Chilean I
and O
booed O
the O
lanky O
American I
, O
who O
ate O
up O
all O
the O
attention O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
an O
emotional O
player O
, O
" O
said O
the O
104th-ranked O
Tarango I
. O
" O

I O
think O
I O
played O
very O
well O
tonight O
, O
very O
focused O
. O
" O

The O
match O
turned O
on O
the O
third-set O
tiebreaker O
, O
which O
the O
American I
won O
7-5 O
much O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O
the O
spectators O
. O

" O
I O
love O
the O
crowd O
if O
they O
boo O
me O
every O
day O
. O

It O
fires O
me O
up O
, O
makes O
me O
play O
my O
best O
tennis O
, O
" O
Tarango I
said O
. O

" O
I O
played O
some O
of O
my O
best O
tennis O
in O
college O
when O
fraternities O
were O
throwing O
beer O
on O
me O
. O

If O
tennis O
was O
like O
that O
every O
day O
, O
I O
think O
everybody O
wold O
be O
having O
a O
lot O
more O
fun O
. O
" O

Rios I
did O
not O
appreciate O
Tarango I
's O
antics O
. O

" O
He O
's O
always O
complaining O
too O
much O
, O
" O
said O
Rios I
. O
" O

But O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
that O
. O

I O
think O
I O
played O
really O
bad O
. O

It O
was O
tough O
to O
play O
at O
night O
. O

Balls O
were O
going O
really O
fast O
. O

I O
lost O
too O
many O
points O
that O
I O
never O
lose O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
play O
my O
tennis O
. O
" O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
ball O
like O
I O
see O
during O
the O
day O
. O

I O
play O
an O
American I
so O
that O
's O
why O
I O
play O
at O
night O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
feel O
good O
on O
the O
court O
. O
" O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
match O
, O
Tarango I
blew O
sarcastic O
kisses O
to O
the O
crowd O
, O
then O
jiggled O
his O
body O
to O
a O
Rios I
rooting O
section O
in O
a O
jeering O
salute O
. O

" O
I O
support O
their O
enthusiasm O
, O
" O
Tarango I
said O
about O
the O
fans O
. O
" O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
they O
're O
cheering O
blatantly O
against O
me O
. O

After O
I O
won O
I O
figured O
I O
could O
give O
them O
a O
little O
razzle-dazzle O
. O
