In O
Dole I
's O
address O
to O
a O
group O
that O
was O
largely O
white O
, O
the O
presidential O
nominee O
likened O
the O
stream O
of O
illegal O
drugs O
into O
the O
United I
States I
to O
missiles O
aimed O
at O
American I
children O
and O
promised O
to O
appoint O
federal O
judges O
who O
would O
be O
tough O
on O
illegal O
drug O
use O
. O

" O
They O
're O
aiming O
millions O
and O
millions O
of O
missiles O
right O
at O
these O
young O
people O
, O
whether O
it O
's O
a O
needle O
, O
whether O
it O
's O
a O
cigarette O
, O
whatever O
the O
delivery O
system O
is O
-- O
it O
's O
poison O
and O
it O
's O
got O
to O
stop O
in O
America I

" O

he O
said O
. O

Dole I
said O
70 O
percent O
of O
the O
cocaine O
that O
entered O
the O
United I
States I
and O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
marijuana O
came O
from O
Mexico I
. O
" O

We O
've O
got O
an O
international O
problem O
and O
I O
'm O
prepared O
to O
use O
our O
military O
might O
. O

We O
want O
to O
stop O
drugs O
at O
the O
border O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Dole I
's O
remarks O
prompted O
questions O
about O
whether O
he O
was O
seeking O
a O
ban O
on O
cigarettes O
. O
" O

I O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
cigarettes O
. O

I O
was O
talking O
about O
drugs O
. O

I O
said O
you O
should O
n't O
smoke O
either O
. O

That O
's O
all O
I O
said O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
as O
he O
was O
shaking O
hands O
with O
well-wishers O
. O

When O
asked O
specifically O
if O
he O
was O
suggesting O
a O
ban O
on O
cigarettes O
, O
Dole I
replied O
: O
" O
Oh O
no O
. O

Come O
on O
, O
you O
know O
better O
than O
that O
. O
" O

Dole I
campaign O
aides O
said O
the O
candidate O
was O
telling O
young O
people O
not O
to O
smoke O
. O

Dole I
also O
said O
he O
opposed O
California I
Proposition I
215 I
which O
, O
if O
approved O
by O
voters O
, O
would O
allow O
the O
cultivation O
of O
marijuana O
plants O
for O
medicinal O
uses O
. O

Dole I
said O
the O
initiative O
would O
allow O
marijuana O
to O
be O
used O
for O
anything O
from O
a O
headache O
to O
an O
ingrown O
toenail O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
paint O
the O
drug O
issue O
in O
non-political O
terms O
, O
Dole I
said O
three O
times O
during O
his O
20-minute O
address O
that O
illegal O
drug O
use O
was O
neither O
a O
Democratic I
nor O
a O
Republican I
issue O
but O
one O
that O
involves O
all O
people O
. O

The O
anti-drug O
message O
is O
a O
theme O
Dole I
feels O
has O
strong O
voter O
appeal O
. O

On O
Sunday O
near O
Chicago I
he O
accused O
President O
Bill I
Clinton I
of O
" O
raising O
the O
white O
flag O
" O
in O
the O
war O
on O
drugs O
. O

A O
recent O
survey O
showed O
that O
illegal O
drug O
use O
among O
12-17 O
year-olds O
had O
doubled O
in O
the O
past O
four O
years O
. O

Dole I
was O
flanked O
by O
several O
California I
Republican I
politicians O
including O
Gov O
. O

Pete I
Wilson I
, O
who O
said O
local O
and O
state O
governments O
cannot O
fight O
illegal O
drugs O
alone O
. O

" O
We O
need O
all O
the O
help O
we O
can O
get O
. O

We O
need O
to O
get O
the O
kind O
of O
help O
we O
used O
to O
get O
when O
Ronald I
Reagan I
and O
George I
Bush I
were O
in O
the O
White I
House I
, O
" O
Wilson I
said O
