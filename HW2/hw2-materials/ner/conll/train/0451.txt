Alexander I
Lebed I
may O
finally O
get O
to O
discuss O
his O
Chechen I
peace O
proposals O
with O
Boris I
Yeltsin I
on O
Tuesday O
after O
a O
lost O
weekend O
in O
the O
region O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
abandon O
plans O
to O
sign O
a O
new O
political O
treaty O
with O
the O
separatist O
rebels O
. O

It O
could O
be O
a O
sobering O
experience O
for O
the O
Kremlin I
security O
chief O
who O
, O
just O
two O
months O
after O
being O
appointed O
by O
the O
president O
and O
two O
heady O
weeks O
after O
taking O
charge O
of O
the O
Chechen I
crisis O
, O
had O
promised O
to O
wrap O
up O
the O
20-month O
war O
by O
the O
weekend O
. O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed I
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow I
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya I
remain O
part O
of O
Russia I
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O
paratroop O
general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O
in O
deadpan O
putdowns O
and O
a O
soldier O
's O
knack O
for O
making O
life O
sound O
simple O
, O
Lebed I
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O
region O
last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian I
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O
into O
the O
rebel-held O
Chechen I
capital O
Grozny I
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

Saying O
he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O
ends O
on O
the O
deal O
-- O
and O
also O
cover O
his O
back O
against O
unnamed O
pro-war O
schemers O
in O
Moscow I
-- O
he O
flew O
back O
to O
the O
capital O
empty-handed O
on O
Sunday O
. O

He O
met O
Russian I
Prime O
Minister O
Viktor I
Chernomyrdin I
on O
Monday O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
press O
service O
of O
Lebed I
's O
Security I
Council I
, O
could O
meet O
Yeltsin I
on O
Tuesday O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin I
's O
holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O
plans O
to O
talk O
. O

Moscow I
's O
as O
yet O
undisclosed O
proposals O
on O
Chechnya I
's O
political O
future O
have O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O
rounds O
of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O
. O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed I
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya I
as O
Yeltsin I
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin I
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed I
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan I
Maskhadov I
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin I
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed I
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow I
. O

Lebed I
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow I
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov I
warned O
that O
Lebed I
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian I
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens I
say O
-- O
Russian I
forces O
. O

Maskhadov I
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed I
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin I
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin I
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya I
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian I
Federation I
-- O
something O
Moscow I
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North I
Caucasus I
. O

Lebed I
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O
. O
