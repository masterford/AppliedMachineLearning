Tomorrow O

the O

" O
OSCE I
spokeswoman O
Agota I
Kuperman I
told O
reporters O
in O
Sarajevo I

" O
I O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
select O
which O
municipal O
elections O
would O
have O
to O
be O
cancelled O
. O

I O
think O
probably O
if O
the O
decision O
( O
to O
cancell O
) O
were O
to O
be O
taken O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
all O
municipal O
elections O

that O
options O
other O
than O
postponement O
were O

specify O
what O
they O
were O

I O

the O

it O
is O

what O
I O

" O
The O
word O
is O
that O
Frowick I

that O
