between O

and O
government O
troops O
that O
Colombo I
says O
has O
cost O
50,000 O
lives O
. O

But O
the O
influx O
has O
triggered O
fears O
of O
a O
repeat O
of O
the O
1980s O
when O
some O
200,000 O
refugees O
landed O
in O
Tamil I
Nadu I
. O

Intelligence O
officals O
said O
more O
than O
5,000 O
Tamils I
were O
waiting O
on O
the O
western O
coast O
of O
Sri I
Lanka I
to O
cross O
into O
India I
. O

The O
Indian I
government O
has O
warned O
its O
fishermen O
that O
their O
boats O
would O
be O
impounded O
if O
they O
were O
caught O
ferrying O
refugees O
. O

The O

went O
on O
strike O
last O

protest O
the O

's O
cancellation O
of O
three O
trawlers O
' O
fishing O
licenses O
after O
the O
boats O
were O
caught O
carrying O
Tamil I
refugees O
. O

All I
Fishermen I
's I
Association I
secretary O
N.J. I
Bose I
said O
the O
strike O
would O
continue O
indefinitely O
and O
the O
fishermen O
would O
block O
road O
and O
rail O
traffic O
if O
their O
demands O
were O
not O
met O
. O

" O
Until O
the O
government O
releases O
our O
boats O
from O
naval O
custody O
and O
Sri I
Lankan I
naval O
custody O
, O
and O
gives O
us O
assurance O
( O
it O
will O
not O
revoke O
licences O
of O
boats O
ferrying O
refugees O
) O
, O
we O
will O
not O
call O
off O
our O
strike O
, O
" O
Bose I
said O
. O

LTTE I
spokesmen O
could O
not O
immediately O
be O
reached O
for O
comment O
, O
but O
Sri I
Lankan I
fishermen O
denied O
that O
Indians I
were O
being O
coerced O
into O
carrying O
refugees O
across O
the O
Palk I
Strait I
. O

" O
Indian I
fishermen O
come O
right O
up O
to O
Pesalai I
to O
fish O
, O
and O
when O
refugees O
request O
them O
to O
ferry O
them O
across O
, O
they O
readily O
oblige O
. O

Only O
some O
take O
money O
, O
" O
Sri I
Lankan I
boatman O
Chinnathambi I
said O
. O

Arulanandam I
denied O
the O
fishermen O
charged O
the O
refugees O
for O
passage O
to O
India I
and O
said O
it O
was O
unfair O
to O
penalise O
them O
for O
the O
refugees O
' O
arrival O
. O

" O
We O
have O
not O
gone O
to O
sea O
since O
August O
19 O
, O
but O
refugees O
are O
arriving O
daily O
nevertheless O
. O

How O
could O
we O
alone O
be O
held O
responsible O
for O
the O
influx O
? O
" O

he O
said O

An O
Indian I
Fisheries I
Department I
official O
said O
the O
government O
planned O
to O
urge O
fishermen O
not O
to O
cross O
the O
international O
boundary O
between O
India I
and O
Sri I
Lanka I
, O
but O
admitted O
this O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
enforce O
because O
of O
Sri I
Lanka I
's O
pomfret-rich O
waters O
