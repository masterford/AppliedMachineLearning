The O
U.S. I
diplomat O

of O
elections O
in O
Bosnia I
announced O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
voting O
for O
municipal O
assemblies O
would O
be O
postponed O
because O
of O
irregularities O
by O
the O
Serbs I
in O
registering O
voters O
. O

Ambassador O
Robert I
Frowick I
, O
representing O
the O
Organisation I
for I
Security I
and I
Cooperation I
in I
Europe I
( O
OSCE I
) O
, O
told O
reporters O
that O
municipal O
polls O
due O
on O
September O
14 O
with O
other O
Bosnian I
elections O
would O
be O
put O
off O
. O

" O
I O
have O
made O
a O
chairman O
's O
decision O
that O
it O
is O
not O
feasible O
to O
hold O
municipal O
elections O
on O
September O
14 O
, O
" O
said O
Frowick I
. O

He O
said O
no O
exact O
date O
had O
been O
set O
but O
it O
was O
possible O
the O
local O
elections O
would O
take O
place O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1997 O
. O

According O
to O
OSCE I
officials O
, O
Serb I
authorities O
have O
pressed O
their O
refugees O
to O
register O
to O
vote O
in O
towns O
now O
under O
Serb I
control O
, O
but O
which O
used O
to O
have O
Moslem I
majorities O
. O

Human O
rights O
workers O
say O
authorities O
in O
Serbia I
and O
Bosnian I
Serb I
territory O
have O
conducted O
a O
well-organised O
campaign O
to O
coerce O
refugees O
into O
registering O
only O
on O
Serb I
territory O
and O
failed O
to O
inform O
them O
of O
their O
rights O
under O
the O
Dayton I
peace O
agreement O
. O

Diplomats O
say O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
electoral O
engineering O
would O
be O
to O
establish O
political O
control O
over O
districts O
they O
conquered O
and O
ethnically O
cleansed O
in O
war O
. O

The O
response O
of O
the O
Bosnian I
Serbs I
to O
the O
OSCE I
's O
announcement O
was O
not O
immediately O
clear O
. O

But O
Bosnian I
Serb I
leaders O
have O
hinted O
they O
would O
boycott O
the O
poll O
if O
the O
municipal O
elections O
were O
postponed O
, O
or O
go O
ahead O
with O
their O
own O
. O

The O
Bosnian I
Serb I
cabinet O
, O
in O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
OSCE I
, O
said O
on O
Monday O
that O
any O
delay O
of O
local O
elections O
would O
be O
" O
a O
direct O
and O
flagrant O
violation O
fo O
the O
Dayton I
agreement O
" O
. O

The O
Serbs I
, O
who O
administer O
half O
of O
Bosnia I
in O
a O
Serb I
republic O
, O
said O
they O
had O
met O
all O
conditions O
for O
holding O
the O
September O
elections O
. O

Diplomats O
fear O
that O
the O
crisis O
could O
cast O
doubt O
over O
the O
entire O
election O
process O
, O
which O
already O
appears O
set O
to O
confirm O
Bosnia I
's O
ethnic O
partition O
rather O
than O
its O
reintegration O
as O
the O
Dayton I
peace O
agreement O
had O
planned O
. O
