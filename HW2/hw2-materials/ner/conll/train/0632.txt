WASHINGTON I
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities I
and I
Exchange I
Commission I
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq I
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC I
Chairman O
Arthur I
Levitt I
. O

The O
SEC I
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC I
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard I
Lindsey I
, O
said O
Wall I
Street I
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC I
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC I
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq I
when O
the O
parent O
of O
the O
Nasdaq I
market O
, O
the O
National I
Association I
of I
Securities I
Dealers I
, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
SEC I
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
1 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq I
. O

The O
SEC I
's O
limit O
order O
display O
rule O
will O
mean O
a O
major O
change O
for O
Nasdaq I
, O
where O
such O
orders O
have O
never O
been O
displayed O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Nasdaq I
, O
Alfred I
Berkeley I
, O
was O
to O
hold O
a O
news O
conference O
Wednesday O
afternoon O
to O
elaborate O
on O
the O
new O
rules O
' O
effects O
on O
the O
market O
, O
the O
second O
largest O
in O
the O
world O
