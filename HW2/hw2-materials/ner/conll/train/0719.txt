" O
For O
the O
most O

they O

understand O
what O

going O
on O
, O
" O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Nagyatad I
camp O
Lajos I
Horvath I
told O
Reuters I
on O
Wednesday O
. O

" O
It O
was O
confusing O
, O
they O
had O
no O
experience O
of O
voting O
, O
many O
of O
the O
refugees O
are O
only O
semi-literate O
and O
none O
of O
them O
knew O
anything O
about O
the O
candidates O
, O
" O

said O

" O
They O
just O
voted O
along O
ethnic O

The O
Bosnian I
election O
is O
set O
for O
September O
14 O
and O
voting O
began O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
most O
of O
the O
600,000 O
Bosnians I
living O
abroad O
. O

The O
Organisation I
for I
Security I
and I
Cooperation I
in I
Europe I
, O
which O
is O
running O
the O
election O
, O
allowed O
the O
ballot O
to O
be O
held O
on O
Sunday O
in O
four O
Hungarian I
refugee O
camps O
. O

Some O
Moslem I
refugees O
among O
the O
385 O
registered O
voters O
Hungary I
's O
largest O
camp O
Nagyatad I
have O
written O
to O
the O
OSCE I
complaining O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
vote O
in O
contests O
for O
the O
president O
or O
assembly O
of O
the O
Bosnian-Croat I
Federation I
, O
where O
most O
Moslems I
live O
. O

This O
was O
because O
their O
pre-war O
homes O
are O
now O
in O
the O
Serb-controlled I
territory O
, O
so O
they O
were O
voting O
for O
the O
national O
assembly O
of O
the O
Republika I
Srbska I
, O
most O
of O
the O
candidates O
for O
which O
are O
Serbs I
. O

For O
the O
foreign O
powers O
which O
back O
last O
year O
's O
Dayton I
peace O
agreement O
, O
the O
main O
point O
of O
the O
election O
rules O
is O
that O
by O
voting O
as O
though O
they O
were O
still O
in O
their O
pre-war O
homes O
, O
Bosnians I
should O
override O
the O
effects O
of O
ethnic O
cleansing O
and O
reassert O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
single O
multi-ethnic O
state O
. O

But O
Adem I
Hodzic I
, O
one O
of O
the O
refugees O
who O
signed O
the O
letter O
of O
complaint O
, O
told O
Reuters I
: O

" O
We O
only O
realised O
after O
voting O
that O
we O
were O
being O
denied O
the O
rights O
of O
other O
Bosnian I
Moslems I
to O
choose O
our O
president O
. O

This O
vote O
seals O
the O
division O
of O
my O
country O

" O
At O
