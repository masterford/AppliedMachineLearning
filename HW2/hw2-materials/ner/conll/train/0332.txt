LONDON I
1996-08-25 O

Chris I
Lewis I
did O
his O
best O
to O
forget O
his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O
England I
one-day O
squad O
on O
Sunday O
but O
could O
not O
prevent O
Pakistan I
reasserting O
their O
dominance O
in O
the O
final O
test O
at O
The I
Oval I
. O

A O
super O
piece O
of O
fielding O
by O
Lewis I
, O
dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O
start O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
, O
provided O
the O
only O
bright O
spot O
for O
England I
as O
the O
touring O
team O
batted O
on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O
. O

The O
solitary O
wicket O
to O
fall O
was O
Asif I
Mujtaba I
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis I
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey I
player O
swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O
team O
mate O
Alec I
Stewart I
who O
whipped O
off O
the O
bails O
. O

Lewis I
, O
though O
, O
could O
not O
make O
similar O
waves O
with O
the O
ball O
as O
Salim I
Malik I
and O
Wasim I
Akram I
batted O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
session O
with O
few O
alarms O
. O

Wasim I
rattled O
along O
to O
30 O
not O
out O
, O
outscoring O
his O
partner O
who O
was O
unbeaten O
on O
24 O
at O
the O
break O
, O
although O
the O
weather O
was O
again O
threatening O
to O
play O
the O
dominant O
role O
. O

Rain O
arrived O
just O
as O
the O
players O
left O
the O
field O
for O
lunch O
, O
forcing O
the O
ground-staff O
into O
action O
yet O
again O
. O

The O
weather O
delayed O
the O
resumption O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
umpires O
finally O
announcing O
play O
would O
start O
again O
at O
1445 O
local O
time O
( O
1345 O
GMT I
) O
