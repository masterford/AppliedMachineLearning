" O
They O
did O
a O
good O
job O
this O

, O
but O
they O
need O
good O

good O

Ivan I

" O

God I
help O

there O

The O
country O

harvest O
this O
year O
is O
forecast O
to O
fall O
by O
more O
than O
23 O
percent O
to O
only O
28 O
million O

and O
two O

factors O
are O
to O
blame O
. O

A O
drought O
scoured O
the O
steppes O
in O
May O
and O
June O
, O
stunting O
the O
growing O
wheat O
. O

And O
the O
farming O
sector O
, O
making O
the O
painful O
transition O
from O
Soviet I
central O
planning O
to O
a O
market O
economy O
simply O
has O
no O
money O
. O

Ukraine I
's O
black O
soil O
is O
so O
fertile O
that O
a O
diplomat O
described O
it O
as O
" O
rich O
enough O
to O
grow O
rubber O
boots O
" O
. O

But O
recently O
Ukraine I
has O
been O
losing O
its O
reputation O
as O
a O
breadbasket O
of O
Europe I
, O
earned O
in O
the O
years O
before O
brutal O
forced O
collectivisation O
under O
Soviet I
dictator O
Josef I
Stalin I
. O

" O
The O
wheat O
will O
not O
be O
of O
a O
good O
quality O
this O
year O
, O
" O
said O
Hryhory I
Borsuk I
, O
a O
scientist O
at O
the O
Mironivka I

Institute I
, O
run O
by O
the O

" O
The O

on O
the O

reached O
62 O

( O

) O
this O
summer O
. O

We O
've O
never O
seen O
anything O
so O
bad O
, O
" O
he O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
in O
his O
office O
, O
unlit O
since O
the O
government O
cut O
off O
electricity O
because O
of O
unpaid O
power O
bills O
. O

The O
harvest O
is O
gathered O
in O
the O
dry O
areas O
, O
but O
rainfall O
in O
Western I
Ukraine I
has O
delayed O
harvesting O
there O
. O

While O
Mironivka I
's O
scientists O
, O
some O
unpaid O
for O
months O
, O
carry O
on O
developing O
new O
strains O
of O
wheat O
resistant O
to O
Ukraine I
's O
extreme O
continental O
climate O
, O
Borsuk I
said O
the O
lack O
of O
cash O
in O
Ukraine I
's O
agricultural O
sector O
is O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
drought O
. O

Collective O
farms O
and O
Ukraine I
's O
nascent O
private O
farming O
sector O
have O
no O
money O
for O
fertiliser O
, O
no O
money O
for O
herbicides O
and O
pesticides O
, O
no O
money O
to O
repair O
old O
or O
buy O
new O
machinery O
, O
no O
money O
for O
fuel O
, O
and O
none O
to O
buy O
good O
seed O
. O

This O
year O
's O
harvest O
is O
down O
from O
last O
year O
's O
36.5 O
million O
tonne O
harvest O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
compares O
with O
50 O
million O
tonnes O
in O
1990 O
, O
the O
year O
before O
independence O
. O

The O
decline O
is O
all O
the O
worse O
for O
people O
who O
recall O
wasteful O
Soviet I
times O
, O
when O
the O
Kremlin I
imported O
grain O
but O
priced O
bread O
so O
cheaply O
that O
people O
bought O
it O
to O
feed O
their O
pigs O
. O

" O
Agriculture O
is O
very O
expensive O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
solutions O
to O
our O
problems O
on O
the O
horizon O
, O
" O
said O
Odnosum I
. O

He O
said O
his O
farm O
, O
its O
260 O
workers O
now O
readying O
the O
fields O
for O
winter O
wheat O
sowing O
, O
expected O
the O
land O
to O
yield O
5.2 O
tonnes O
per O
hectare O
( O
2.5 O
acres O
) O
but O
ended O
up O
with O
3.9 O
tonnes O
-- O
still O
better O
than O
the O
national O
average O
of O
2.11 O
tonnes O
per O
hectare O
this O
year O
. O

" O
We O
did O
not O
have O
money O
for O
fertiliser O
, O
we O
're O
in O
debt O
for O
fuel O
, O
and O
we O
're O
borrowing O

, O
" O
Odnosum I
said O

A O

said O
the O

many O

not O

Soprun I
said O
. O
" O

People O
are O
working O
out O
of O
their O
own O
dedication O
. O
" O

Borsuk I
said O
the O
farm O
sector O
has O
two O
options O
: O
" O
We O
can O
sit O
down O
and O
cry O
, O
or O
we O
can O
do O
something O
. O
" O

He O
said O
the O
government O
plans O
to O
increase O
the O
sowing O
of O
the O
winter O
wheat O
which O
will O
be O
harvested O
next O
year O
. O

Planted O
in O
late O
summer O
and O
early O
autumn O
, O
the O
grain O
is O
Ukraine I
's O
largest O
export O
item O
and O
traditionally O
grows O
better O
than O
summer O
wheat O
in O
Ukraine I
's O
soil O
. O

Further O
plans O
, O
he O
said O
, O
called O
for O
full O
provision O
of O
resources O
like O
fertiliser O
and O
herbicides O
for O
25 O
percent O
of O
Ukraine I
's O
arable O
land O
next O
year O
, O
for O
50 O
percent O
in O
1998 O
and O
100 O
percent O
of O
the O
land O
in O
1999 O
. O

" O
If O
we O
follow O
this O
we O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
sell O
10 O
million O
tonnes O
of O
grain O
by O
the O
year O
2000 O
, O
" O
Borkus I
said O
. O

The O
government O
has O
been O
trying O
to O
phase O
out O
huge O
subsidies O
to O
the O
farm O
sector O
, O
and O
in O
a O
move O
back O
to O
pre-Soviet I
days O
has O
given O
up O
to O
50 O
hectares O
( O
124 O
acres O
) O
of O
land O
to O
some O
36,000 O
private O
farmers O
willing O
to O
go O
it O
alone O
. O

Collective O
farms O
will O
last O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
, O
because O
most O
private O
farms O
now O
only O
produce O
enough O
to O
feed O
themselves O
with O
maybe O
a O
little O
extra O
to O
sell O
, O
said O
one O
private O
farmer O
: O
" O
In O
the O
future O
, O
maybe O
, O
but O
it O
's O
better O
not O
to O
hurry O
. O

" O
Collectivisation O
brought O
us O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
. O

And O
it O
went O
too O
fast O
. O

Privatising O
too O
quickly O
can O
also O
have O
a O
negative O
outcome O
