he O
and O
other O
Democrats I
who O

always O
felt O
left O
out O
in O
their O

party O
. O

" O
But O
this O
year O
is O
different O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
the O

a O
conscience O
clause O
, O
" O
he O

. O

The O
clause O
recognizes O
and O
welcomes O
Democrats I
with O
divergent O
views O
on O
abortion O
and O
states O
they O
have O
a O
full O
part O
to O
play O
at O
all O
levels O

the O
party O
. O

" O
The O

from O
speaking O
. O

Republicans I
have O
used O
their O
decision O
as O
an O
example O
of O
Democrat I
intolerance O
ever O
since O
. O

Casey I
told O
a O
news O
conference O
in O
Chicago I
on O
Tuesday O
he O
had O
asked O
to O
speak O
again O
this O
year O
but O
was O
turned O
down O
. O

Democratic I
leaders O
said O
there O
was O
not O
room O
on O
the O
program O
for O
every O
retired O
governor O
to O
speak O
. O

" O
I O
believe O
the O
Democratic I

ought O
to O
be O
pro-woman O
, O
pro-child O
and O
pro-life O
, O
" O
Casey I
said O
. O

" O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
opportunity O
to O
deliver O
this O
message O
from O
the O
podium O
of O
the O
Democrat I
National I
Convention I
. O

For O
the O
second O
time O
in O
four O
years O
, O
my O
request O
fell O
on O
deaf O
ears O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

The O
Republican I
Party I
, O
whose O
platform O
calls O
for O
making O
all O
abortions O
illegal O
, O
faced O
a O
similar O
dilemma O
this O
year O
when O
Massachusetts I
Gov O
. O

William I
Weld I
asked O
to O
deliver O
a O
speech O
defending O
abortion O
rights O
and O
was O
turned O
down O
. O

Bob I
Dole I
, O
the O
Republican I
presidential O
nominee O
, O
tried O
and O
failed O
to O
insert O
a O
tolerance O
clause O
in O
his O
party O
's O
platform O
recognizing O
the O
validity O
of O
those O
within O
the O
party O
who O
supported O
abortion O
rights O
. O

Democrats I
also O
heard O
Tuesday O
two O
passionate O
speeches O
defending O
abortion O
rights O
. O

Kate I

Action I
League I
, O
described O
how O
she O
had O
an O
abortion O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
procedure O
was O
illegal O
after O
her O
husband O
abandoned O
her O
with O
three O
young O
children O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
here O
to O
speak O
up O
for O
choice O
and O
to O
speak O
for O
truth O
. O

The O
message O
from O
the O
Republican I
Party I
is O
one O
of O
disdain O
. O

Their O
answer O
to O
choice O
is O
control O
and O
punishment O
. O

Our O
answer O
is O
trust O
, O
compassion O
and O
respect O
, O
" O
she O
said O

Georgia I
Rep I

Cynthia I
McKinney I
said O
: O
" O
You O
make O
your O
moral O
decisions O

make O
mine O
and O
