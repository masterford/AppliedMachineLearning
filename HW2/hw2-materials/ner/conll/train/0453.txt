arms O

the O

the O

production O
. O

" O
We O

are O
met O
, O
" O
said O
the O
factory O
's O
trade O
union O
secretary O
Dragutin I
Stanojlovic I
. O

" O
We O
are O
united O
and O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
government O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
with O
us O
. O
" O

Trade O

July O

holiday O
pay O
, O
and O
called O
on O
government O
to O
develop O
a O
revival O
programme O
for O
the O

The O
former O
Yugoslav I
national O
army O
consumed O
90 O
percent O
of O
Zastava I
's O
pre-war O
output O
, O
but O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
Yugoslavia I
's O
economy O
, O
the O
new O
army O
of O
Serbia I
and O
Montenegro I
is O
crippled O
by O
lack O
of O
funds O
. O

In O
Kragujevac I
where O
the O
plant O
is O
based O
, O
9,000 O
to O
10,000 O

in O
the O
central O
square O
to O
express O
their O
bitterness O
at O
what O
Stanojlovic I
called O
government O
indifference O
. O

The O
ruling O
Socialist I
Party I
last O
week O
accused O
Serbia I
's O
opposition O
of O
stirring O
up O
social O
unrest O
and O
using O
workers O
' O
already O
difficult O
social O
position O
for O
their O
own O
interests O
. O

" O
Late O
wages O
, O
no O
work O
and O
( O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
) O
production O
programme O
are O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
their O
protests O
, O
" O
a O
senior O
member O
of O
the O
local O
Socialist I
Party I
branch O
told O
Reuters I
. O

" O
But O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
influence O
of O
opposition O
parties O
that O
are O
collecting O
points O
ahead O
of O
coming O
elections O
. O
" O

Federal O
Yugoslav I
elections O
are O
due O
on O
November O

The O
party O
official O
said O
the O
union O
's O
figure O
on O
the O
number O
of O
protesters O
was O
exaggerated O
. O
" O

There O
were O
about O
1,400 O
to O
1,600 O
people O
at O
the O
protest O
today O
-- O
much O
less O
then O
