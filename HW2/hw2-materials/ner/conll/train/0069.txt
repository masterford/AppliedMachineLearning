Garlic O
pills O
may O
not O
lower O
blood O
cholesterol O
and O
studies O
that O
show O
they O
do O
may O
be O
flawed O
, O
British I
researchers O
have O
reported O
. O

A O
study O
by O
a O
team O
of O
doctors O
at O
Oxford I
University I
has O
found O
people O
with O
high O
blood O
cholesterol O
do O
not O
benefit O
significantly O
from O
taking O
garlic O
tablets O
. O

The O
study O
involved O
115 O
people O
with O
high O
blood O
cholesterol O
levels O
. O

They O
were O
given O
900 O
milligrams O
a O
day O
of O
dried O
garlic O
powder O
or O
placebo O
tablets O
. O
" O

There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
between O
the O
groups O
receiving O
garlic O
and O
placebo O
, O
" O
they O
wrote O
in O
the O
Journal I
of I
the I
Royal I
College I
of I
Physicians I
. O

Those O
taking O
part O
were O
told O
to O
eat O
a O
low-fat O
diet O
for O
six O
weeks O
before O
they O
started O
taking O
the O
pills O
, O
and O
their O
blood O
cholesterol O
measured O
before O
and O
after O
the O
six-week O
period O
. O

The O
researchers O
said O
this O
would O
make O
their O
findings O
more O
accurate O
. O

Several O
studies O
have O
found O
garlic O
pills O
can O
lower O
blood O
pressure O
and O
blood O
cholesterol O
. O

But O
the O
Oxford I
team O
disputed O
these O
findings O
and O
said O
either O
previous O
trials O
may O
have O
been O
interpreted O
incorrectly O
, O
those O
taking O
part O
were O
not O
given O
special O
diets O
beforehand O
or O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
studies O
may O
have O
been O
too O
short O
. O

The O
six-month O
trial O
was O
funded O
by O
the O
British I
Heart I
Foundation I
and O
Lichtwer I
Pharma I
GmbH I
, O
which O
makes O
Kwai I
brand O
garlic O
tablets O
. O

The O
study O
did O
not O
address O
whether O
whole O
garlic O
could O
affect O
cholesterol O
. O
