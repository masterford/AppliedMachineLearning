O.J. I
Simpson I
said O
on O
Thursday O
he O
was O
financially O
broken O
by O
his O
defence O
against O
murder O
charges O
but O
he O
was O
hopeful O
new O
evidence O
to O
support O
him O
would O
be O
available O
for O
a O
civil O
trial O
next O
month O
. O

The O
former O
football O
star O
was O
found O
not O
guilty O
by O
a O
criminal O
trial O
jury O
last O
October O
of O
the O
murders O
of O
his O
former O
wife O
, O
Nicole I
Brown I
Simpson I
, O
and O
her O
friend O
, O
Ronald I
Goldman I
, O
in O
June O

. O

He O
now O
faces O
a O
civil O
suit O
brought O
by O
families O
of O
the O
victims O
who O
hold O
him O
responsible O
for O
the O
deaths O
. O

He O
told O
reporters O
a O
court O
order O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
his O
case O
kept O
him O
from O
detailing O
how O
he O
has O
fulfilled O
his O
pledge O
to O
find O
the O
killers O
. O

But O
he O
added O
without O
elaborating O
, O
" O
hopefully O
we O
will O
see O
some O
things O
come O
out O
in O
this O
next O
trial O
. O
" O

The O
judge O
in O
the O
civil O
trial O
has O
imposed O
a O
sweeping O
gag O
order O
that O
prohibits O
lawyers O
, O
witnesses O
and O
parties O
to O
the O
case O
from O
discussing O
it O
with O
the O
media O
or O
elsewhere O
in O
public O
. O

" O
I O
would O
love O
to O
speak O
about O
everything O
, O
" O
said O
Simpson I
, O
who O
vowed O
after O
his O
acquittal O
to O
find O
the O
killers O
and O
offered O
a O
substantial O
reward O
. O

His O
lawyers O
have O
said O
his O
defence O
in O
the O
civil O
trial O
that O
starts O
Sept O
. O

17 O
will O
be O
that O
he O
did O
not O
kill O
the O
victims O
. O

Simpson I
said O
at O
the O
hotel O
news O
conference O
his O
plans O
include O
eventually O
writing O
another O
book O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
has O
had O
job O
offers O
but O
more O
have O
come O
from O
abroad O
than O
at O
home O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
broke O
. O

I O
am O
not O
crying O
the O
blues O
. O

I O
can O
get O
along O
just O
fine O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

Whatever O
you O
want O
to O
send O
me O
, O
I O
need O
. O
" O

He O
again O
accused O
the O
news O
media O
of O
erroneous O
reporting O
on O
his O
case O
but O
did O
not O
signal O
any O
plans O
for O
lawsuits O
as O
he O
did O
on O
Wednesday O
in O
an O
address O
at O
a O
jam-packed O
Washington I
church O
. O

Contrary O
to O
news O
reports O
, O
Simpson I
said O
, O
he O
has O
received O
support O
from O
both O
blacks O
and O
whites O
. O

He O
again O
dismissed O
charges O
that O
he O
had O
distanced O
himself O
from O
the O
black O
community O
during O
his O
successful O
football O
and O
commercial O
career O
, O
only O
to O
seek O
their O
support O
after O
he O
faced O
murder O
charges O
. O

A O
crowd O
of O
2,000 O
paid O
$ O
10 O
a O
head O
to O
hear O
the O
former O
star O
running O
back O
for O
the O
Buffalo I
Bills I
professional O
football O
club O
and O
a O
Football I
Hall I
of I
Fame I
member O
on O
Wednesday O
night O
. O

The O
crowd O
in O
the O
church O
was O
wildly O
supportive O
, O
showering O
Simpson I
with O
gifts O
and O
praise O
. O

But O
outside O
, O
dozens O
of O
protesters O
from O
the O
D.C. I
Coalition I
Against I
Domestic I
Violence I
called O
for O
the O
church O
to O
support O
victims O
of O
violence O
instead O
