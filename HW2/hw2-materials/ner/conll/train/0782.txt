he O
believes O
that O
the O

( O
BOJ I
) O
interest O
rate O
policy O
which O
is O
geared O

its O

it O
did O
not O

needed O

would O
not O
lead O

any O

decision O
on O
the O
need O

" O
I O
do O

think O
we O
should O

a O
conclusion O
that O
the O
economic O

has O
come O
to O
a O
halt O
or O
that O
signs O
of O
a O

contraction O
have O
