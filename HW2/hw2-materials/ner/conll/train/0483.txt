" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
ask O
this O
question O
. O

What O
would O
Wisconsin I
face O
if O
the O

extremist O
coalition O
, O
the O
Gingrich I
/ I
Dole I
Congress I

also O
controlled O
the O

two O
or O
three O
Supreme I
Court I
justice O
nominations O
, O
he O
warned O
, O
" O
Their O
extremist O
agenda O
would O
come O
out O
of O
the O
Gingrich I
Congress I

into O
and O
through O
the O
Dole I
White I
House I
, O
down O
through O
the O
Supreme I
Court I
. O
" O

He O
painted O
a O
scene O
of O
horrors O
he O
saw O
if O

controlled O
the O
White I
House I
and O
the O
Congress I
they O
hold O
now O
. O
" O

Our O
personal O

at O

of O
being O
taken O
away O
from O

from O
the O
polluters O
that O
control O
that O
coalition O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

His O
new O
style O
mixed O
an O
assault O
on O
Republicans I
with O
what O
he O
sees O
as O
" O
productive O
opportunity O
, O
a O
vision O
for O
the O
future O
that O
lifts O
up O

a O
warmed-over O
plan O
that O
failed O

drove O
our O
economy O
into O
a O
ditch O

got O
burned O
once O

we O
wo O

the O
