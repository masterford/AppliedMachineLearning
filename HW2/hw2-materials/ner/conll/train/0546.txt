but O
analysts O
expect O
a O
rebound O
in O
the O
long O
term O
. O

" O
The O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
expected O
so O
the O
company O
will O
probably O
be O
unable O
to O
reach O
its O
annual O
plan O
in O
1996 O

between O
one-third O
of O
two-fifths O

said O
Tamas I
Erdei I
, O
a O
Budapest-based I
analyst O
for O

Analysts O
blame O
, O
at O
least O
partly O
, O
Hungary I
's O
macroeconomic O
environment O
for O
the O
weaker O
figures O
for O
Cofinec I
which O
, O
operating O
in O
Hungary I
, O
Poland I
and O
the O
Czech I
Republic I
, O
now O
generates O
about O
55 O
to O
60 O
percent O
of O
its O
annual O
sales O
from O
Hungary I

Hungary I

7.2 O

points O
in O
the O
first O
half O
of O
1996 O
. O

Both O
will O
have O
their O
impact O
on O
Cofinec I
's O
figures O
, O
the O
analysts O
said O
. O

Despite O
the O
current O
difficulties O
, O
however O
, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O
Cofinec I
's O
outlook O
was O
strong O
. O

" O
The O
eastern O
European I
market O
offers O
good O
chances O
, O
" O
said O
Erdei I
. O
" O

Just O
like O
many O
other O
companies O
on O
the O
bourse O
, O
Cofinec I
has O
big O
growth O
opportunities O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
's O
an O
advantage O
for O
Cofinec I
that O
it O
has O
a O
foreign O
management O
which O
perhaps O
understands O
the O
market O
better O
, O
" O
Erdei I
added O
. O

" O
Cofinec I
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O
per O
capita O
packaging O
consumption O
is O
still O
so O
low O
in O
east O
Europe I
that O
a O
very O
strong O
increase O
can O
be O
expected O
( O
long-term O
) O
, O
" O
Sitanyi I
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O
moves O
by O
Cofinec I
boosted O
its O
position O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
Cofinec I
had O
acquired O
the O
outstanding O
stake O
in O
its O
Czech I
folding O
company O
Krpaco I
a.s. I
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O
to O
100 O
percent O
, O
so O
in O
the O
second O
half O
the O
whole O
of O
Krpaco I
's O
figures O
will O
be O
consolidated O
. O

The O
company O
also O
repaid O
some O
$ O
21 O
million O
of O
debt O
, O
well O
above O
the O
originally O
planned O
$ O
8 O
million O
to O
$ O
9 O
million O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
its O
Polish I
operation O
began O
with O
some O
six O
weeks O
of O
delay O
due O
to O
cold O
winter O
weather O
and O
the O
test O
run O
was O
also O
longer O
than O
planned O
. O
