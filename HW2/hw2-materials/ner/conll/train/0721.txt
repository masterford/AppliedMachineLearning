Russian I
security O
chief O
Aleksander I
Lebed I
faces O
an O
almost O
impossible O
task O
in O
Chechnya I
and O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
sidelined O
, O
Polish I
Foreign O
Minister O
Dariusz I
Rosati I
was O
reported O
as O
saying O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

According O
to O
best-selling O
daily O
Gazeta I
Wyborcza I
, O
Rosati I
told O
the O
Polish I
parliament O
's O
foreign O
affairs O
committee O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
the O
fact O
Lebed I
had O
been O
charged O
with O
resolving O
the O
conflict O
in O
Chechnya I
showed O
he O
would O
be O
marginalised O
. O

" O
It O
is O
almost O
impossible O
to O
gain O
success O
in O
this O
, O
" O
it O
quoted O
Rosati I
as O
saying O
during O
a O
committee O
debate O
. O

" O
Lebed I
has O
no O
diplomatic O
experience O
. O

Yeltsin I
sent O
him O
there O
to O
compromise O
him O
. O

This O
tactical O
manoeuvre O
also O
shows O
that O
in O
the O
ruling O
circle O
there O
is O
no O
unity O
of O
action O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Lebed I
, O
who O
has O
arranged O
a O
military O
truce O
with O
separatist O
rebels O
in O
the O
southern O
Russia I
region O
, O
was O
in O
Moscow I
this O
week O
seeking O
support O
for O
a O
deal O
on O
Chechnya I
's O
political O
status O
. O

But O
Russian I
President O
Boris I
Yeltsin I
has O
seemed O
unwilling O
to O
meet O
his O
envoy O
and O
went O
on O
holiday O
on O
Monday O
. O

Gazeta I
Wyborcza I
quoted O
Rosati I
as O
saying O
Yeltsin I
was O
very O
ill O
and O
effectively O
on O
leave O
, O
but O
for O
now O
retained O
control O
in O
Russia I
although O
matters O
were O
passing O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
his O
close O
collaborators O
. O

Rosati I
said O
Russia I
's O
July O
polls O
, O
in O
which O
Yeltsin I
won O
re-election O
, O
showed O
democracy O
had O
passed O
an O
important O
test O
and O
the O
Russian I
people O
had O
chosed O
the O
path O
of O
further O
reforms O
. O

But O
he O
said O
a O
power O
struggle O
in O
Russia I
's O
ruling O
circles O
could O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
, O
which O
could O
harm O
further O
reforms O
. O

He O
expressed O
concern O
over O
problems O
in O
the O
Russian I
economy O
, O
saying O
this O
could O
lead O
to O
social O
unrest O
, O
the O
daily O
reported O
. O

On O
Moscow I
's O
foreign O
policy O
, O
Rosati I
said O
it O
had O
changed O
its O
stance O
on O
NATO I
's O
eastward O
expansion O
and O
was O
preparing O
itself O
for O
Poland I
's O
inevitable O
entry O
into O
the O
Western I
alliance O
. O

He O
also O
reportedly O
criticised O
Russian I
Foreign O
Minister O
Yevgeny I
Primakov I
, O
saying O
his O
style O
of O
work O
resembled O
that O
of O
the O
Soviet-era I
1970s O
and O
1980s O
