Morris I
declined O
to O
address O

in O
his O
resignation O
statement O
but O
said O
he O
was O
quitting O

avoid O

issue O
. O

The O
surprise O
development O
captivated O
the O
thousands O
of O
reporters O
at O
the O
convention O
and O
clearly O
worried O
some O
Democrats I
, O
who O
had O
planned O
a O
triumphal O
celebration O
of O
Clinton I
's O
lead O
over O
Dole I
in O

Senator O
Dianne I

, O
a O
California I

, O
called O
it O
a O
" O
big O
bump O
" O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
Clinton I
campaign O
. O

" O
It O
comes O
at O
the O
worst O
possible O
time O
on O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
days O
for O
the O
president O
, O
" O
Feinstein I
said O
. O

Clinton I
was O
to O
deliver O

acceptance O
speech O

the O
final O
session O
of O
the O
Democratic I
Convention I
opening O
at O
8 O
p.m. O
EDT O
( O
midnight O
GMT I
) O
. O

The O
50-year-old O
president O
has O
been O
dogged O
for O
years O
by O
allegations O
of O
financial O
wrongdoing O
, O
sexual O
misconduct O
and O
questionable O
judgment O
in O
selecting O
his O
advisers O
. O

Republicans I
hope O
to O
seize O
on O
the O
" O
character O
" O
issue O
to O
bolster O
Clinton I
's O
challenger O
Bob I
Dole I
in O
the O
final O
weeks O
of O
the O
campaign O
. O

Speaking O
in O
Santa I
Barbara I
, O
California I
, O
Dole I
did O
not O
directly O
refer O
to O
the O
sexual O
scandal O
but O
said O
the O
departure O
of O
Morris I
, O
who O
had O
advised O
Clinton I
to O
chart O
a O
more O
centrist O
political O
course O
, O
would O
make O
Clinton I
drift O
back O
to O
the O
left O
. O

" O
Morris I
has O
been O
trying O
to O
make O
President O
Clinton I
a O
Republican I
, O
now O
maybe O
he O
'll O
revert O
to O
the O
liberal O
Democrat I
that O
he O
really O
is O
, O
" O
Dole I
told O
reporters O
. O

Clinton I
will O
hit O
the O
road O
on O
Friday O
for O
a O
bus O
tour O
across O
several O
states O
in O
his O
fight O
to O
become O
the O
first O
Democratic I
incumbent O
re-elected O
to O
a O
second O
term O
since O
the O
days O
of O
Franklin I
D. I
Roosevelt I
. O

Aides O
said O
Clinton I
planned O
to O
spend O
most O
of O
Thursday O
in O
his O
hotel O
room O
several O
miles O
( O
km O
) O
from O
the O
convention O
hall O
working O
on O
his O
speech O
. O

It O
was O
apparently O
neglected O
on O
his O
long O
" O
whistle-stop O
" O
train O
trip O
to O
the O
convention O
, O
during O
which O
he O
revelled O
in O
contact O
with O
friendly O
crowds O
across O
the O
country O
's O
heartland O
. O

He O
was O
also O
hoarse O
and O
was O
giving O
his O
voice O
a O
rest O
. O

But O
first O
lady O
Hillary I
Rodham I
Clinton I
told O
ABC I
television O
, O
" O
He O
's O
really O
fired O
up O
. O
" O

" O
He O
wants O
to O
outline O
to O
the O
American I
people O
what O
he O
thinks O
has O
been O
accomplished O
in O
the O
last O
four O
years O
, O
and O
what O
he O
would O
like O
to O
see O
done O
in O
the O
next O
four O
years O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
He O
's O
very O
excited O
about O
this O
convention O
... O

He O
's O
excited O
about O
the O
campaign O
. O

But O
more O
than O
that O
, O
he O
's O
very O
resolute O
about O
what O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
. O
" O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
anything O
for O
granted O
. O

I O
always O
expect O
elections O
to O
get O
close O
. O

I O
expect O
to O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
up O
and O
down O
days O
between O
now O
and O
then O
, O
" O
she O
said O
of O
the O
November O
5 O
election O
date O
. O

Clinton I
is O
leading O
Dole I
by O
as O
much O
as O
15 O
points O
according O
to O
some O
polls O
. O

The O
campaign O
pits O
Dole I
, O
a O
man O
of O
quick O
and O
withering O
wit O
and O
long-time O
public O
service O
, O
but O
stilted O
speaking O
style O
, O
against O
the O
glib O
and O
confident O
Clinton I
, O
who O
has O
perfected O
a O
style O
that O
makes O
direct O
eye O
contact O
with O
his O
audience O
. O
