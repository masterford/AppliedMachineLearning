But O
Lebed I
himself O
, O
the O
Kremlin I

, O
is O
still O
waiting O
back O
in O
Moscow I
to O
meet O
Yeltsin I
over O
his O
plans O
for O
a O
lasting O
political O
settlement O
in O
Chechnya I

Itar-Tass I
news O
agency O
quoted O
the O
Kremlin I
press O
service O
as O

a O
state O

home O
near O

, O

Lebed I
interrupted O
talks O
with O
Chechnya I
's O
separatists O
on O
a O
political O
deal O
on O
Sunday O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
to O
consult O
with O
Yeltsin I
. O

After O
a O
meeting O
failed O
to O
materialise O
on O
Monday O
, O
Lebed I
's O
spokesman O
said O
he O
might O
meet O
the O
president O
on O
Tuesday O
. O

But O
Yeltsin I
's O
spokesman O
rebuffed O
the O
suggestion O
, O
saying O
the O
president O
had O
left O
Moscow I
for O
a O
holiday O
near O
the O
capital O
. O

The O
Russians I
postponed O
the O
talks O
after O
a O
Chechen I
band O
disarmed O
a O
column O
of O
interior I
ministry I
troops O
on O
Sunday O
. O

The O
Chechens I
said O
a O
renegade O
group O
seized O
the O
weapons O
and O
said O
on O
Monday O
they O
had O
all O
been O
returned O
. O

The O
Russian I
command O
insisted O
that O
not O
all O
the O
weapons O
were O
the O
same O
as O
those O
taken O
. O

Tass I
said O
the O
weapons O
and O
the O
practical O
implementation O
of O
the O
ceasefire O
signed O
by O
Lebed I
and O
Maskhadov I
last O
Thursday O
would O
be O
on O
the O
agenda O
of O
today O
's O
talks O
. O

Neither O
spoke O
to O
reporters O
before O
the O
meeting O
, O
which O
started O
around O
10.45 O
a.m. O
( O
0645 O
GMT I
) O
. O

Also O
in O
Novye I
Atagi I
on O
Tuesday O
morning O
, O
was O
Tim I
Guldimann I
, O
the O
Swiss I
diplomat O
who O
heads O
the O
Chechnya I
mission O
of O
the O
Organisation I
for I
Security I
and I
Cooperation I
in I
Europe I
( O
OSCE I
) O
. O

Guldimann I
, O
who O
helped O
broker O
an O
earlier O
truce O
in O
May O
, O
was O
not O
taking O
part O
in O
the O
Tikhomirov-Maskhadov I
talks O
. O

Lebed I
's O
peace O
mission O
this O
month O
has O
stopped O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
20-month-old O
conflict O
. O

However O
, O
tension O
on O
the O
ground O
indicates O
that O
it O
could O
falter O
if O
the O
momentum O
for O
a O
settlement O
is O
not O
maintained O
. O

Three O
Russian I
servicemen O
were O
wounded O
in O
a O
total O
of O
six O
shooting O
incidents O
overnight O
, O
Itar-Tass I
news O
agency O
quoted O
the O
Russian I
military O
as O
saying O
on O
Tuesday O
morning O
. O

RIA I
news O
agency O
quoted O
an O
army O
source O
accusing O
rebel O
fighters O
of O
failing O
to O
turn O
up O
for O
joint O
Russian-Chechen I
police O
patrols O
in O
some O
districts O
of O
the O
capital O
Grozny I
on O
Tuesday O
. O

But O
the O
separatist O
command O
told O
Interfax I
news O
agency O
the O
patrols O
, O
part O
of O
the O
truce O
brokered O
by O
Lebed I
last O
week O
, O
would O
begin O
on O
Tuesday O
after O
delays O
for O
" O
technical O
reasons O
" O
. O

Yeltsin I
's O
spokesman O
said O
he O
might O
meet O
officials O
during O
his O
break O
, O
but O
indicated O
Lebed I
was O
low O
on O
the O
list O
by O
saying O
Yeltsin I
would O
need O
time O
to O
study O
the O
proposals O
before O
talking O
to O
him O
. O

Russian I
news O
agencies O
also O
quoted O
the O
Kremlin I
spokesman O
as O
saying O
that O
Lebed I
's O
representatives O
had O
not O
sought O
a O
meeting O
, O
hinting O
at O
an O
attempt O
by O
the O
president O
to O
put O
his O
popular O
and O
outspoken O
protege O
in O
his O
place O
with O
a O
lesson O
on O
protocol O
. O

Yeltsin I
, O
65 O
, O
has O
kept O
a O
low O
profile O
since O
he O
was O
reelected O
in O
July O
, O
prompting O
new O
speculation O
that O
the O
two O
heart O
attacks O
he O
suffered O
last O
year O
and O
a O
rumoured O
drinking O
problem O
could O
be O
taking O
their O
toll O
, O
weakening O
his O
grip O
on O
affairs O
of O
state O
. O

Aides O
have O
dismissed O
such O
speculation O
, O
insisting O
that O
he O
simply O
needs O
a O
rest O
after O
his O
energetic O
election O
campaign O
. O

Some O
analysts O
say O
the O
Kremlin I
leader O
, O
whose O
order O
sending O
troops O
and O
tanks O
into O
Chechnya I
in O
1994 O
started O
Russia I
's O
ill-fated O
military O
campaign O
, O
could O
merely O
be O
reluctant O
to O
put O
his O
name O
to O
a O
peace O
process O
which O
might O
fall O
apart O
. O

But O
Lebed I
, O
who O
has O
no O
real O
power O
without O
his O
boss O
and O
has O
hinted O
at O
dark O
forces O
in O
Moscow I
working O
against O
him O
, O
appears O
to O
think O
a O
deal O
will O
not O
stick O
without O
strong O
backing O
from O
Yeltsin I
. O

His O
proposals O
have O
not O
been O
spelled O
out O
but O
are O
expected O
to O
involve O
a O
compromise O
between O
the O
separatists O
' O
demand O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow I
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya I
remain O
part O
of O
the O
Russian I
Federation I
. O
