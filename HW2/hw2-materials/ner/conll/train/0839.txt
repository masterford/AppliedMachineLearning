NATO I
forces O
released O
a O
group O
of O
Bosnian I
Serb I
policemen O
late O
on O
Thursday O
and O
a O
tense O
confrontation O
appeared O
to O
be O
easing O
, O
an O
alliance O
spokesman O
said O
. O

" O
The O
situation O
in O
Mahala I
seems O
to O
be O
very O
much O
on O
its O
way O
toward O
resolution O
. O

My O
understanding O
is O
the O
( O
Serb I
) O
police O
have O
been O
released O
... O

In O
Zvornik I
, O
we O
think O
the O
situation O
is O
winding O
down O
as O
well O
, O
" O
NATO I
spokesman O
Lieutenant O
Colonel O
Max I
Marriner I
told O
Reuters I
. O

NATO I
troops O
detained O
65 O
Bosnian I
Serb I
policemen O
early O
on O
Thursday O
after O
they O
attacked O
Moslem I
refugees O
returning O
to O
homes O
in O
Mahala I
, O
a O
Serb-controlled I
village O
on O
Bosnia I
's O
internal O
boundary O
line O
. O

In O
apparent O
retaliation O
for O
NATO I
's O
detention O
of O
the O
Serbs I
, O
an O
angry O
Serb I
mob O
including O
policemen O
trapped O
six O
unarmed O
U.N. I
police O
monitors O
and O
three O
local O
aides O
in O
their O
office O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Zvornik I
, O
east O
of O
Mahala I
. O

Marriner I
said O
NATO I
forces O
confiscated O
25 O
long-barreled O
AK-47 I
automatic O
assault O
rifles O
from O
the O
detained O
Serbs I
before O
setting O
them O
free O
. O

" O
Local O
radio O
and O
television O
there O
( O
in O
Zvornik I
) O
are O
advising O
people O
to O
step O
back O
and O
take O
it O
easy O
. O

We O
think O
that O
when O
the O
word O
about O
how O
things O
are O
going O
in O
Mahala I
which O
is O
about O
35 O
minutes O
away O
by O
road O
reaches O
Zvornik I
that O
should O
help O
