Up O
to O
100,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
held O
in O
Shanghai I
bonded O
warehouses O
, O
confounding O
the O
world O
market O
as O
to O
its O
source O
and O
ultimate O
fate O
, O
probably O
belongs O
to O
China I
's O
strategic O
state O
reserve O
, O
industry O
sources O
said O
on O
Friday O
. O

Around O
40,000 O
tonnes O
of O
the O
copper O
have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O
warehouses O
near O
the O
northern O
port O
of O
Yingkou I
, O
where O
some O
of O
the O
strategic O
stockpile O
was O
stored O
, O
they O
said O
. O

Just O
who O
owns O
the O
copper O
is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O
traders O
and O
industry O
analysts O
guessing O
since O
the O
metal O
was O
channelled O
into O
Shanghai I
by O
the O
China I
National I
Nonferrous I
Metals I
Import I
and I
Export I
Corp I
( O
CNIEC I
) O
in O
June O
and O
July O
. O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
40,000 O
tonnes O
had O
cleared O
customs O
-- O
which O
would O
provide O
some O
concrete O
indication O
that O
the O
strategic O
reserve O
, O
administered O
directly O
by O
the O
central O
government O
's O
State I
Planning I
Commission I
, O
owned O
the O
copper O
. O

Traders O
have O
said O
the O
reserve O
could O
negotiate O
concessions O
on O
duties O
-- O
three O
percent O
import O
tax O
and O
17 O
percent O
value-added O
tax O
-- O
that O
made O
the O
copper O
prohibitively O
expensive O
otherwise O
. O

But O
one O
source O
, O
the O
head O
of O
a O
Hong I
Kong I
trading O
house O
, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O
copper O
was O
customs O
cleared O
or O
not O
. O

" O
If O
they O
spend O
all O
this O
money O
moving O
the O
copper O
to O
Yingkou I
, O
it O
will O
be O
sitting O
there O
for O
years O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Once O
it O
arrives O
in O
Yingkou I
, O
it O
is O
subject O
to O
monitoring O
by O
the O
State I
Planning I
Commission I
, O
which O
has O
to O
give O
permission O
for O
any O
more O
movement O
; O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
traders O

said O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai I
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O
traders O
unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O
owns O
it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O
long-term O
backwardation O
on O
the O
London I
Metal I
Exchange I
( O
LME I
) O
. O

A O
backwardation O
occurs O
when O
the O
spot O
price O
of O
a O
metal O
is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O
. O

CNIEC I
lent O
around O
85,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
onto O
the O
LME I
between O
April O
and O
June O
1995 O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
state O
reserve O
, O
running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia I
said O
CNIEC I
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ I
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O
and O
$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC I
a O
healthy O
profit O
, O
which O
could O
then O
have O
been O
used O
to O
finance O
storage O
and O
other O
costs O
. O

Word O
that O
CNIEC I
had O
offered O
the O
copper O
to O
European I
trading O
houses O
in O
a O
series O
of O
secret O
meetings O
unnerved O
an O
already O
jittery O
market O
. O

said O
on O
Wednesday O
the O
motivation O
of O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
85,000 O
tonnes O
, O
" O
whoever O
they O
are O
, O
is O
the O
most O
important O
short-term O
fundamental O
" O
in O
an O
already O
tight O

BME I
repeated O
in O
its O
latest O
review O
rumours O
of O
involvement O
by O
Sumitomo I
Corp I
, O
with O
CNIEC I
said O
to O
be O
helping O
the O
Japanese I
trader O
unload O
its O
copper O
positions O
after O
it O
revealed O
in O
June O
losses O
of O
$ O
1.8 O
billion O
in O
a O
decade O
of O
unauthorised O
deals O
. O

Sumitomo I
and O
CNIEC I
have O
made O
no O
comments O
on O
the O
talk O
and O
Chinese I
traders O
said O
they O
know O
nothing O
of O
such O
an O
arrangement O
. O

Traders O
in O
Shanghai I
said O
on O
Thursday O
they O
were O
unaware O
of O
movements O
out O
of O
the O
Shanghai I
bonded O
warehouses O
. O

They O
reported O
more O
arrivals O
that O
were O
probably O
spot O
purchases O
. O

They O
also O
expressed O
concern O
that O
the O
tonnage O
in O
bonded O
warehouses O
would O
move O
onto O
the O
domestic O
market O
. O

But O
these O
concerns O
were O
irrelevant O
, O
a O
Singapore I
trader O
said O
, O
despite O
a O
forecast O
that O
domestic O
Chinese I
copper O
demand O
could O
hit O
one O
million O
tonnes O
this O
year O
. O

As O
with O
many O
commodities O
, O
" O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
( O
by O
the O
Chinese I
government O
) O
to O
keep O
a O
stockpile O
of O
the O
metal O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

You O
do O
n't O
keep O
it O
to O
help O
industry O
, O
you O
keep O
it O
in O
case O
of O
emergency O
. O
