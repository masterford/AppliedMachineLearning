Michael I
Stich I
nearly O
pulled O
out O
of O
the O
U.S. I
Open I
in O
protest O
over O
the O
men O
's O
seeding O
fiasco O
but O
the O
former O
Wimbledon I
champion O
was O
glad O
he O
stayed O
after O
sweating O
out O
a O
four-set O
win O
on O
Monday O
over O
qualifier O
Tommy I
Haas I
. O

" O
I O
still O
feel O
it O
's O
embarrassing O
what O
happened O
and O
I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O
, O
' O
That O
's O
it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich I
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

" O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
play O
, O
especially O
spectators O
and O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
out O
here O
and O
want O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
tennis O
, O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O
" O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open I
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O
accordance O
with O
ATP I
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O
account O
other O
factors O
that O
raised O
objections O
of O
favourtism O
toward O
U.S. I
players O
. O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open I
was O
French I
Open I
champion O
Yvegeny I
Kafelnikov I
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP I
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia I
. O

Kafelnikov I
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O
's O
tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

At O
a O
news O
conference O
attended O
by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O
Sunday O
, O
U.S. I
Davis I
Cup I
player O
Todd I
Martin I
expressed O
the O
players O
' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. I
Open I
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. I
Open I
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin I
said O
. O

Stich I
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA I
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich I
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich I
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand I
Slam I
. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O
step O
with O
his O
6-3 O
1-6 O
6-1 O
7-5 O
win O
over O
compatriot O
Haas I
on O
a O
sun-baked O
Grandstand I
court O
. O

Others O
advancing O
early O
on O
Monday O
included O
11th-seeded O
American I
Malivai I
Washington I
, O
the O
Wimbledon I
runner-up O
, O
Sweden I
's O
Magnus I
Gustafsson I
, O
and O
two-time O
former O
French I
Open I
champion O
Sergi I
Bruguera I
of O
Spain I
, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich I
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich I
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. I
Open I
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American I
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich I
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open I
final O
to O
Andre I
Agassi I
. O

It O
was O
Agassi I
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American I
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP I
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi I
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich I
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi I
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French I
Open I
and O
Wimbledon I
. O

Stich I
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov I
withdrew O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich I
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain I
's O
Felix I
Mantilla I
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O
in O
the O
Open I
and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich I
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
, O
" O
Stich I
said O
