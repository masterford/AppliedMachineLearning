his O
wife O
, O
" O
though O
great O
is O
the O
present O
national O
difficulties O
yet O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
a O
brighter O
day O
when O
I O
shall O
have O
the O
oportunity O
of O
seeing O
you O
in O
the O
full O
enjoyment O
of O
freedom O

" O
I O
would O
like O
to O
no O
( O
sic O
) O
if O
you O
are O
still O
in O
slavery O
if O
you O
are O
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
long O
before O
we O
shall O
have O
crushed O
the O
system O
that O
now O
oppreses O
you O
for O
in O
the O
course O
of O
three O
months O
you O
shall O
have O
your O
liberty O
. O

Great O
is O
the O
outpouring O
of O
the O
coloured O
people O
that O
is O
now O
rallying O
with O
the O
heart O
of O
lions O
against O
the O
very O
curse O
that O
has O
separated O
you O
and O
me O
. O

In O
another O

dated O

to O
plead O
for O
her O
son O
, O
who O
faced O
a O
dishonourable O
discharge O
from O
the O
Army I

James I
is O
a O

for O
a O
thoughtless O
act O

folly O
, O
while O
those O
who O
have O
done O
nothing O
for O
the O
cause O
are O
free O
, O
" O
she O
wrote O
. O

Lincoln I
's O
notation O
on O
the O
letter O
read O
: O
" O
If O
his O
colonel O
will O
say O
in O
writing O
on O
this O
sheet O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
receive O
this O
man O
back O
to O
the O
regiment O
, O
I O
will O
pardon O
and O
send O
him O

" O

The O
soldier O

subsequently O
pardoned O

While O
the O
letters O
speak O
to O
the O
anguish O
of O
separation O
, O

speaks O
to O
the O
terrible O
physical O
cost O

The O
work O
on O
black O
troops O
has O
provided O
new O
insight O
into O
the O
rhythms O
of O
plantation O
talk O

" O
These O
( O
writings O
) O
are O
not O
only O
poetic O
but O
a O
linguistic O
treasure O
trove O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
generation O
of O
African I
Americans I
that O
really O
can O
express O
itself O
without O
fear O
and O
punishment O
, O
" O
Simon I
said O
. O

" O
I O
think O
there O
's O
probably O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
material O
that O
would O
expand O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
sociology O
of O
the O
war O

The O
war O
between O
the O
North I
and O
South I
raged O
for O
nearly O
four O
years O
, O
claimed O
the O
lives O
of O
half O
a O
million O
Americans I
and O
forever O
seared O
the O
nation O

consciousness O

Southern I
records O
have O
already O
been O
preserved O
. O

They O
were O
put O
on O
microfilm O
about O
30 O
years O
ago O
through O
a O
grant O
from O
the O
United I
Daughters I

Director O
Budge I
Weidman I
, O
who O
has O
shepherded O
the O
project O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
predicts O
it O
will O
take O
up O
to O
a O
decade O
to O
complete O
. O

The O
work O
was O
inspired O
by O
a O
National I
Park I
Service I
plan O
to O
put O
computer O
databases O
at O
Civil I
War I
battlefields O
across O
the O
country O
so O
that O
Americans I
might O
research O
their O
ancestors O
. O

The O
records O
also O
provide O
insight O
into O
medical O
thinking O
of O
the O
day O
. O

One O
soldier O
was O
discharged O
because O
of O
" O
mental O
incapacity O

of O
the O
brain O

alleged O
by O
the O
Patient O
to O
be O
connected O
with O
a O
fall O
on O
the O

believed O
to O
arise O
from O
