DUBLIN I
1996-08-27 O

Ireland I
's O
most O
experienced O
player O
, O
defender O
Paul I
McGrath I
, O
was O
left O
out O
of O
the O
national O
squad O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
11 O
years O
on O
Tuesday O
when O
new O
manager O
Mick I
McCarthy I
named O
his O
side O
to O
face O
Liechtenstein I
in O
a O
World I
Cup I
qualifier O
. O

The O
36-year-old O
Aston I
Villa I
player O
won O
the O
last O
of O
his O
Irish I
record O
of O
82 O
international O
caps O
against O
the O
Czech I
Republic I
in O
Prague I
in O
April O
. O

" O
Paul I
accepted O
the O
situation O
. O

He O
has O
n't O
played O
any O
first-team O
games O
for O
Villa I
this O
season O
and O
he O
's O
not O
the O
type O
of O
player O
I O
would O
have O
brought O
on O
as O
a O
substitute O
, O
" O
McCarthy I
said O
. O
" O

But O
he O
surprised O
me O
in O
training O
over O
the O
last O
two O
days O
because O
of O
his O
involvement O
. O

He O
's O
certainly O
is O
still O
very O
much O
part O
of O
my O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
. O

" O
At O
24 O
, O
25 O
or O
26 O
you O
could O
get O
away O
with O
it O
, O
not O
having O
played O
first-team O
games O
. O

But O
at O
36 O
it O
would O
be O
asking O
too O
much O
of O
Paul I
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Also O
omitted O
from O
the O
20-man O
squad O
which O
will O
travel O
to O
Vaduz I
for O
Saturday O
's O
group O
eight O
match O
are O
central O
defenders O
Alan I
Kernaghan I
and O
Liam I
Daish I
. O

Leeds I
United I
defender O
Gary I
Kelly I
is O
unable O
to O
travel O
because O
of O
a O
knee O
injury O
picked O
up O
in O
Monday O
's O
1-0 O
victory O
over O
Wimbledon I
at O
Elland I
Road I
. O

Since O
taking O
over O
from O
Jack I
Charlton I
in O
February O
, O
McCarthy I
has O
played O
largely O
experimental O
sides O
and O
seen O
them O
lose O
five O
times O
, O
draw O
twice O
and O
win O
just O
once O
. O
