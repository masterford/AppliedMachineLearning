legislature O
. O

Accusing O
Israeli I
Prime O
Minister O
Benjamin I
Netanyahu I
of O
stupidity O
, O
Arafat I
launched O
his O
strongest O
attack O
on O
the O
right-wing O
government O
since O
its O
election O
in O
May O
. O

The O
tirade O
was O
sparked O
by O
Israel I
's O
announcement O
on O
Tuesday O
of O
plans O
to O
expand O
the O
Jewish I
settlement O
of O
Kiryat I
Sefer I
and O
its O
demolishing O
of O
a O
community O
centre O
in O
Arab I
East I
Jerusalem I
. O

" O
Israel I
has O
started O
the O

on O

. O
" O

There O
will O
be O
no O
Palestinian I
state O
without O
Jerusalem I

Netanyahu I
should O
know O
he O

when O

troops O
began O
withdrawing O
under O
an O
interim O
self-rule O
agreement O
signed O
in O
1993 O
. O

The O
strike O
will O
have O
little O
effect O
on O
the O
Israeli I
economy O
while O
hurting O
Palestinian I
merchants O
in O
East I
Jerusalem I
and O
Bethlehem I
who O
cater O
to O
the O
tourist O
trade O
. O

Some O
25,000 O
Palestinian I

likely O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
their O
jobs O
, O
mainly O
in O
construction O
, O
in O
Israel I
. O

But O
Palestinians I
, O
once O
the O
backbone O
of O
the O
building O
industry O
, O
have O
been O
largely O
replaced O
by O
labourers O
from O
Romania I
and O
China I
. O

behind O
them O
, O
" O
Arafat I
said O
. O

Netanyahu I
, O
who O
opposes O

central O
issue O
in O

, O
accusing O

Prime O
Minister O

claims O
both O
halves O
of O
the O
city O
as O
its O
capital O
. O

The O
PLO I
wants O
East I
Jerusalem I
as O
the O
capital O
of O
a O
future O
Palestinian I
state O
. O

In O
his O
speech O
to O
the O
crowded O
legislature O
, O
Arafat I
signalled O
he O
was O
not O
abandoning O
diplomacy O
although O
" O
alarm O
bells O
are O
ringing O

unexpectedly O
broke O
