Corporate O

is O
planning O
major O
changes O
in O
employee O
compensation O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years O
, O
according O
to O
a O
recent O
study O
. O

What O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
is O
this O
: O
If O
you O
're O
highly O
skilled O
, O
you O
'll O
benefit O
nicely O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
not O
and O
cannot O
contribute O
to O
your O
employer O
's O
goals O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
paid O
less O

The O
survey O
, O
conducted O
in O
late O
1995 O
and O
the O
early O
part O
of O
this O
year O
by O
management O
consulting O
firm O
Towers I
Perrin I
, O
showed O
that O
the O
focus O
will O
be O
on O
an O
employee O
's O
overall O
value O
to O
the O
company O
's O
bottom O
line O
-- O
rather O
than O
how O
well O
an O
employee O
performs O
a O
specific O
task O
. O

Presently O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
an O
accountant O
's O
job O
involves O
doing O
five O
specific O
tasks O
, O
he O
or O
she O
can O
expect O
a O
certain O
salary O
, O
said O
Sandra I
O'Neal I
, O
a O
Towers I
Perrin I
principal O
. O

In O
the O
future O
, O
the O
accountant O
will O
be O
evaluated O
solely O
on O
" O
knowledge O
, O
skill O
and O
abilities O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
using O
accounting O
skills O
, O
the O
accountant O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
creative O
, O
work O
well O
in O
a O
team O
, O
be O
sensitive O
to O
customer O
needs O
and O
set O
productivity O
goals O
. O

" O
The O
good O
news O
is O
, O
if O
you O
're O
highly O
skilled O
and O
have O
many O
abilities O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
paid O
more O
, O
" O
said O
O'Neal I
. O

" O
The O
bad O
news O
is O
, O
if O
you O
're O
not O
skilled O
and O
ca O
n't O
contribute O
to O
a O
team O
, O
to O
customer O
service O
and O
the O
organisation O
's O
goals O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
paid O
less O
. O

Of O
the O
750 O
mid-to-large O
size O
corporations O
surveyed O
, O
81 O
percent O
had O
undergone O
a O
major O
restructuring O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
, O
and O
more O
than O
two-thirds O
reported O
that O
productivity O
and O
profits O
were O
up O
as O
result O
. O

Next O
on O
the O
agenda O
for O
these O
firms O
is O
developing O
a O
new O
compensation O
structure O
, O
and O
78 O
percent O
report O
that O
they O
are O
considering O
a O
new O
, O
skills-based O
plan O
for O
both O
management O
and O
non-management O
employees O
. O

This O
coming O
shift O
, O
O'Neal I
said O
, O
" O
is O
not O
just O
isolated O
or O
a O
fad O
. O

It O
's O
an O
inexorable O
change O
. O
" O

After O
World I
War I
II I
, O
corporations O
adopted O
a O
" O
military O
model O
" O
creating O
hierarchical O
organisations O
where O
" O
the O
concept O
of O
defined O
tasks O
worked O
great O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

But O
as O
the O
economy O
became O
global O
, O
customers O
were O
more O
demanding O
and O
problems O
became O
more O
complex O
. O

" O
Multi-layers O
kept O
management O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
its O
customers O
, O
" O
O'Neal I
said O
. O

Now O
organisations O
must O
change O
to O
stay O
competitive O
. O

O'Neal I
says O
firms O
will O
place O
a O
greater O
emphasis O
on O
teams O
and O
team O
performance O
in O
giving O
raises O
. O

If O
your O
team O
does O
well O
, O
you O
'll O
do O
well O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
do O
well O
, O
do O
n't O
expect O
a O
raise O
. O

Is O
this O
fair O
to O
an O
employee O
who O
can O
go O
the O
distance O
but O
is O
on O
a O
team O
that O
ca O
n't O
keep O
up O
? O

" O
That O
's O
an O
important O
question O
we O
used O
to O
ask O
a O
lot O
, O
" O
said O
O'Neal I
. O
" O

It O
's O
not O
a O
question O
we O
ask O
any O
more O
. O

The O
more O
important O
question O
is O
-- O
' O
Do O
we O
have O
results O
? O
' O

" O

To O
get O
those O
results O
, O
27 O
percent O
of O
the O
companies O
surveyed O
plan O
to O
eliminate O
base O
pay O
increases O
in O
favour O
of O
cash O
bonuses O
and O
incentives O
, O
such O
as O
employee O
and O
team O
award O
programmes O
and O
education O
. O

Companies O
that O
can O
change O
their O
culture O
and O
view O
employees O
as O
business O
partners O
will O
do O
well O
, O
O'Neal I
said O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
survey O
rated O
some O
participants O
in O
the O
survey O
as O
" O
high-performing O
" O
companies O
, O
based O
on O
their O
return O
on O
equity O
above O
16 O
percent O
. O

Those O
companies O
also O
said O
they O
already O
offer O
employees O
variable O
pay O
and O
business O
education O
, O
give O
their O
managers O
more O
control O
over O
pay O
decisions O
and O
celebrate O
employee O
and O
team O
success O
. O

" O
They O
respect O
employees O
more O
, O
they O
trust O
employees O
more O
and O
they O
value O
their O
employees O
more O
, O
" O
O'Neal I
said O
. O

" O
The O
key O
to O
success O
at O
high-performance O
companies O
is O
engaging O
employees O
in O
a O
business O
partnership O
. O
