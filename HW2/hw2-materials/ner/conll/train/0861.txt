University I

Pennsylvania I
researchers O
on O
Thursday O
said O
a O
new O
gene-therapy O
technique O
for O
treating O
muscular O
dystrophy O
disease O
had O
shown O
progress O
in O
laboratory O
animals O
. O

Word O

the O
findings O

came O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
annual O
Jerry I
Lewis I
Labour I
Day I
weekend O
telethon O
to O
raise O
money O
for O
muscular O
dystrophy O
research O
. O

Several O
hurdles O
must O
be O
overcome O
before O
the O
method O
is O
used O
in O
human O
trials O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
" O
a O
treatment O
based O
on O
the O
new O
strategy O
.... O
may O
have O
the O
potential O
to O
benefit O
many O
patients O
, O
" O

said O
in O
a O
release O

Muscular O
dystrophy O
is O
a O
fatal O
illness O
in O
which O
the O
body O
's O
muscle O
tissue O
degenerates O
and O
is O
replaced O
by O
fat O
. O

Death O
strikes O
in O
early O
adulthood O
. O

Individuals O
with O
the O
disease O
have O
a O
non-working O
version O
of O
a O
gene O
responsible O
for O
producing O
a O
crucial O
muscle O
protein O
called O
dystrophin O
. O

In O
the O
study O
at O
the O
University O
's O
Institute I
for I
Human I
Gene I
Therapy I
, O
researchers O
altered O
a O
common-cold O
virus O
to O
carry O
a O
version O
of O
the O
working O
dystrophin O
gene O
. O

The O
virus O
, O
which O
also O
was O
altered O
to O
minimise O
its O
susceptibility O
to O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
was O
then O
injected O
into O
the O
muscle O
cells O
of O
mice O
bred O
to O
lack O
dystrophin O
genes O
. O

In O
the O
experiment O
, O
between O
30 O
to O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
muscle O
fibers O
in O
one O
group O
of O
mice O
produced O
dystrophin O
for O
two O
weeks O
before O
diminishing O
. O

Similar O
results O
had O
been O
obtained O
previously O
in O
test-tube O
cell O
cultures O
, O
but O
not O
in O
live O
animals O

university O
said O

The O
university O
said O
methods O
are O
still O
needed O
to O
make O
enough O
of O
the O
altered O
virus O
to O
treat O
humans O
, O
to O
further O
decrease O
the O
immune-system O
response O
to O
the O
virus O
, O
and O
to O
deliver O
the O
virus O
to O
human O
muscle O
