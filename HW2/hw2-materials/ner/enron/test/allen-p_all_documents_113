Structure O
STRUCTURE: O
Typically O
the O
structure O
is O
a O
limited O
partnership O
with O
a O
corporate O
( O
or O
LLC O
) O
general O
partner O
. O

The O
General O
Partner O
owns O
1% O
of O
the O
project O
and O
carries O
the O
liability O
of O
construction O
. O

LAND O
OWNERSHIP O
& O
LOANS O
The O
property O
would O
be O
purchased O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
limited O
partnership O
and O
any O
land O
loans O
, O
land O
improvements O
loans O
and O
construction O
loans O
would O
be O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
limited O
partnership O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
individual O
investors O
and O
all O
of O
the O
principals O
in O
Creekside I
would O
also O
personally O
guarantee O
the O
loans O
. O

If O
the O
investor O
( O
s O
) O
do O
not O
sign O
on O
the O
loans O
, O
this O
generally O
means O
that O
a O
larger O
amount O
of O
cash O
is O
required O
and O
the O
investor O
's O
share O
of O
profits O
is O
reduced O
. O

All O
loans O
for O
residential O
construction O
, O
that O
are O
intended O
for O
re-sale O
, O
are O
full O
recourse O
loans O
. O

If O
we O
are O
pursuing O
multifamily O
rental O
developments O
, O
the O
construction O
loans O
are O
still O
full O
recourse O
but O
the O
mortgage O
can O
often O
be O
non-recourse O
. O

USE O
OF O
INITIAL O
INVESTMENT O
The O
initial O
investment O
is O
used O
for O
land O
deposit O
, O
engineering O
& O
architectural O
design O
, O
soils O
tests O
, O
surveys O
, O
filing O
fees O
, O
legal O
fees O
for O
organization O
and O
condominium O
association O
formation O
, O
and O
appraisals O
. O

Unlike O
many O
real O
estate O
investment O
programs O
, O
none O
of O
the O
funds O
are O
used O
for O
fees O
to O
Creekside I
Builders I
, I
LLC I
. O

These O
professional O
expenses O
will O
be O
incurred O
over O
the O
estimated O
6 O
month O
design O
and O
approval O
period O
. O

EARLY O
LAND O
COSTS O
The O
$4,000 O
per O
month O
costs O
listed O
in O
the O
cash O
flow O
as O
part O
of O
land O
cost O
represent O
the O
extension O
fees O
due O
to O
the O
seller O
for O
up O
to O
4 O
months O
of O
extensions O
on O
closing O
. O

As O
an O
alternative O
, O
we O
can O
close O
into O
a O
land O
loan O
at O
probably O
70% O
of O
appraised O
value O
. O

With O
a O
land O
value O
equal O
to O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
$680,000 O
this O
would O
mean O
a O
land O
loan O
of O
$476,000 O
with O
estimated O
monthly O
interest O
payments O
of O
$3,966 O
, O
given O
a O
10% O
annual O
interest O
rate O
, O
plus O
approximately O
1.25% O
of O
the O
loan O
amount O
for O
closing O
costs O
and O
loan O
fees O
. O

EQUITY O
AT O
IMPROVEMENT O
LOAN O
Once O
the O
site O
plan O
is O
approved O
by O
the O
City I
of I
Austin I
, O
the O
City O
will O
require O
the O
development O
entity O
to O
post O
funds O
for O
fiscal O
improvements O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
" O
fiscals O
" O
. O

This O
cost O
represents O
a O
bond O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
improvements O
that O
COA I
considers O
vital O
and O
these O
funds O
are O
released O
once O
the O
improvements O
have O
been O
completed O
and O
accepted O
by O
COA I
. O

This O
release O
will O
be O
for O
90% O
of O
the O
cost O
with O
the O
remaining O
10% O
released O
one O
year O
after O
completion O
. O

Releases O
can O
be O
granted O
once O
every O
90 O
days O
and O
you O
should O
expect O
that O
the O
release O
would O
occur O
6 O
months O
after O
the O
start O
of O
lot O
improvement O
construction O
. O

These O
fiscals O
are O
usually O
posted O
in O
cash O
or O
an O
irrevocable O
letter O
of O
credit O
. O

As O
such O
, O
they O
have O
to O
be O
counted O
as O
a O
development O
cost O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
not O
spent O
. O

Because O
they O
are O
not O
spent O
no O
interest O
is O
charged O
on O
these O
funds O
. O

The O
lot O
improvement O
loan O
is O
typically O
75% O
of O
the O
appraised O
value O
of O
a O
finished O
lot O
, O
which O
I O
suspect O
will O
be O
at O
least O
$20,000 O
and O
potentially O
as O
high O
as O
$25,000 O
. O

This O
would O
produce O
a O
loan O
amount O
of O
$15,000 O
on O
$20,000 O
per O
lot O
. O

With O
estimated O
per O
lot O
improvement O
costs O
of O
$9,000 O
, O
'fiscals' O
at O
$2,000 O
and O
the O
land O
cost O
at O
$8,000 O
, O
total O
improved O
lot O
cost O
is O
$19,000 O
which O
means O
$0 O
to O
$4,000 O
per O
lot O
in O
total O
equity O
. O

The O
investment O
prior O
to O
obtaining O
the O
improvement O
loan O
would O
count O
towards O
any O
equity O
requirement O
provided O
it O
was O
for O
direct O
costs O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
additional O
equity O
for O
the O
improvement O
loan O
would O
be O
$0-$184,000 O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
maximum O
loan O
would O
cover O
all O
costs O
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
the O
bank O
would O
allow O
reimbursement O
of O
funds O
spent O
. O

The O
higher O
estimates O
of O
equity O
investments O
are O
shown O
in O
the O
preliminary O
proforma O
to O
be O
on O
the O
safe O
side O
. O

The O
engineer O
is O
preparing O
a O
tentative O
site O
layout O
with O
an O
initial O
evaluation O
of O
the O
phasing O
, O
which O
can O
significantly O
reduce O
the O
cash O
equity O
requirement O
. O

Phasing O
works O
as O
follows O
. O

If O
the O
first O
phase O
was O
say O
40 O
units O
, O
the O
total O
lot O
improvement O
cost O
might O
average O
$31,000 O
per O
lot O
. O

Of O
this O
, O
probably O
$13,000 O
would O
be O
for O
improvements O
and O
$19,000 O
for O
the O
land O
cost O
. O

The O
improvements O
are O
higher O
to O
cover O
large O
one O
time O
up O
front O
costs O
for O
design O
costs O
, O
the O
entry O
road O
, O
water O
treatment O
costs O
, O
perimeter O
fencing O
and O
landscaping O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
100% O
of O
the O
land O
. O

The O
land O
loan O
for O
undeveloped O
lots O
would O
be O
70% O
of O
the O
appraised O
raw O
lot O
value O
, O
which O
I O
would O
estimate O
as O
$10,000 O
per O
lot O
for O
a O
loan O
value O
of O
$7,000 O
per O
lot O
. O

Then O
the O
loan O
value O
for O
each O
improved O
lot O
would O
be O
$15,000 O
per O
lot O
. O

This O
would O
give O
you O
a O
total O
loan O
of O
$992,000 O
, O
total O
cost O
of O
$1,232,645 O
for O
equity O
required O
of O
$241,000 O
. O

This O
was O
not O
presented O
in O
the O
initial O
analysis O
as O
the O
phasing O
is O
depended O
on O
a O
more O
careful O
assessment O
by O
the O
Civil O
Engineer O
as O
the O
separate O
phases O
must O
each O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
on O
its O
own O
from O
a O
utility O
standpoint O
. O

CONSTRUCTION O
LOANS O
There O
are O
three O
types O
of O
construction O
loans O
. O

First O
, O
is O
a O
speculative O
( O
spec O
) O
loan O
that O
is O
taken O
out O
prior O
to O
any O
pre-sales O
activity O
. O

Second O
, O
is O
a O
construction O
loan O
for O
a O
pre-sold O
unit O
, O
but O
the O
loan O
remains O
in O
the O
builder/developers O
name O
. O

Third O
, O
is O
a O
pre-sold O
unit O
with O
the O
construction O
loan O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
buyer O
. O

We O
expect O
to O
have O
up O
to O
8 O
spec O
loans O
to O
start O
the O
project O
and O
expect O
all O
other O
loans O
to O
be O
pre-sold O
units O
with O
loans O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
builder/developer O
. O

We O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
have O
any O
construction O
loans O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
buyers O
, O
as O
such O
loans O
are O
too O
difficult O
to O
manage O
and O
please O
new O
buyers O
unfamiliar O
with O
the O
process O
. O

Spec O
loans O
will O
be O
for O
70% O
to O
75% O
of O
value O
and O
construction O
loans O
for O
pre-sold O
units O
, O
if O
the O
construction O
loan O
is O
from O
the O
mortgage O
lender O
, O
will O
be O
from O
80% O
to O
95% O
of O
value O
. O

DISBURSEMENTS O
Disbursements O
will O
be O
handled O
by O
the O
General O
Partner O
to O
cover O
current O
and O
near O
term O
third O
party O
costs O
, O
then O
to O
necessary O
reserves O
, O
then O
to O
priority O
payments O
and O
then O
to O
the O
partners O
per O
the O
agreement O
. O

The O
General O
Partner O
will O
contract O
with O
Creekside I
Builders I
, I
LLC I
to O
construct O
the O
units O
and O
the O
fee O
to O
CB I
will O
include O
a O
construction O
management O
and O
overhead O
fee O
equal O
to O
15% O
of O
the O
direct O
hard O
cost O
excluding O
land O
, O
financing O
and O
sales O
costs O
. O

These O
fees O
are O
the O
only O
monies O
to O
Creekside I
, O
Larry I
Lewter I
or O
myself O
prior O
to O
calculation O
of O
profit O
, O
except O
for O
a O
) O
direct O
reimbursement O
for O
partnership O
expenses O
and O
b O
) O
direct O
payment O
to O
CB I
for O
any O
subcontractor O
costs O
that O
it O
has O
to O
perform O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
CB I
cannot O
find O
a O
good O
trim O
carpenter O
sub O
, O
or O
cannot O
find O
enough O
trim O
carpenters O
, O
etc. O
, O
and O
it O
decides O
to O
undertake O
this O
function O
, O
it O
will O
charge O
the O
partnership O
the O
same O
fee O
it O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
from O
third O
parties O
and O
will O
disclose O
those O
cases O
to O
the O
partnership O
. O

Finally O
, O
CB I
will O
receive O
a O
fee O
for O
the O
use O
of O
any O
of O
its O
equipment O
if O
it O
is O
used O
in O
lieu O
of O
leasing O
equipment O
from O
others O
. O

At O
present O
CB I
does O
not O
own O
any O
significant O
equipment O
, O
but O
it O
is O
considering O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
sky O
track O
to O
facilitate O
and O
speed O
up O
framing O
, O
cornice O
, O
roofing O
and O
drywall O
spreading O
. O

REPORTING O
We O
are O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
provide O
reports O
to O
track O
expenses O
vs. O
plan O
. O

What O
did O
you O
have O
in O
mind O
? O

I O
would O
like O
to O
use O
some O
form O
of O
internet O

INVESTOR O
INPUT O
We O
are O
glad O
to O
have O
the O
investor O
's O
input O
on O
design O
and O
materials O
. O

As O
always O
the O
question O
will O
be O
who O
has O
final O
say O
if O
there O
is O
disagreement O
, O
but O
in O
my O
experience O
I O
have O
always O
been O
able O
to O
reach O
consensus O
. O

As O
you O
, O
and O
I O
presume O
Keith I
, O
want O
to O
be O
involved O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O

we O
would O
make O

In O
the O
EXTREMELY O
