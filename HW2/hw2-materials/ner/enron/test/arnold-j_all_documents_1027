Quiz O
I O
belong O
to O
a O
natgas O
discussion O
group O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

This O
is O
from O
one O
of O
the O
guys O
. O

Basically O
they O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
gastraders O
from O
various O
firms O
( O
a O
lot O
of O
producers O
, O
some O
industrials O
, O
some O
small O
shops O
and O
few O
i--banker O
types O
) O
I O
found O
the O
test O
to O
be O
mildly O
amusing O
. O

And O
since O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
'club O
no O
minors' O
was-- O
i O
was O
hoping O
for O
some O
insight O
from O
you O
guys O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
lovely O
Ms. I
Shipos I
was O
able O
to O
fill O
me O
in O
. O

Anyway O
, O
while O
occasionally O
garbage O
, O
the O
discussions O
do O
provide O
insight O
on O
what O
others O
are O
thinking O
of O
production O
, O
storage O
and O
other O
such O
matters O
. O

And O
when O
I O
was O
a O
marketer O
, O
I O
found O
a O
few O
leads O
. O

Finally O
, O
since O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
information O
revolves O
around O
gossip O
about O
a O
particular O
's O
uper O
trader' O
at O
the O
big O
ENE I
, O
i O
find O
it O
amusing O
that O
one O
of O
the O
most O
reserved O
and O
modest O
individuals O
I O
know O
is O
so O
talked O
about O
on O
the O
internet O
. O
