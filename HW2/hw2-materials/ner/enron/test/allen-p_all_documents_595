George I
, O
Here O
is O
a O
spreadsheet O
that O
illustrates O
the O
payout O
of O
investment O
and O
builders O
profit O
. O

Check O
my O
math O
, O
but O
it O
looks O
like O
all O
the O
builders O
profit O
would O
be O
recouped O
in O
the O
first O
year O
of O
operation O
. O

At O
permanent O
financing O
$1.1 O
would O
be O
paid O
, O
leaving O
only O
.3 O
to O
pay O
out O
in O
the O
1st O
year O
. O

Since O
almost O
80% O
of O
builders O
profit O
is O
repaid O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
investment O
, O
I O
feel O
the O
65/35 O
is O
a O
fair O
split O
. O

However O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
I O
think O
we O
should O
negotiate O
to O
layer O
on O
additional O
equity O
to O
you O
as O
part O
of O
the O
construction O
contract O
. O

Just O
to O
begin O
the O
brainstorming O
on O
what O
a O
construction O
agreement O
might O
look O
like O
here O
are O
a O
few O
ideas: O
1 O
. O

Fixed O
construction O
profit O
of O
$1.4 O
million O
. O

Builder O
doesn't O
benefit O
from O
higher O
cost O
, O
rather O
suffers O
as O
an O
equity O
holder O
. O

2. O
+5% O
equity O
for O
meeting O
time O
and O
costs O
in O
original O
plan O
( O
$51/sq O
ft O
, O
phase O
1 O
complete O
in O
November O
) O
+5% O
equity O
for O
under O
budget O
and O
ahead O
of O
schedule O
-5% O
equity O
for O
over O
budget O
and O
behind O
schedule O
This O
way O
if O
things O
go O
according O
to O
plan O
the O
final O
split O
would O
be O
60/40 O
, O
but O
could O
be O
as O
favorable O
as O
55/45 O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
what O
is O
budget O
and O
schedule O
must O
be O
discussed O
and O
agreed O
upon O
. O
