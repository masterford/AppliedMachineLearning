If O
you O
are O
currently O
an O
analyst O
in O
a O
commercial O
rotation O
, O
then O
you O
are O
eligible O
for O
promotion O
to O
a O
third O
year O
analyst O
. O

After O
you O
have O
completed O
your O
third O
year O
, O
then O
you O
are O
eligible O
for O
promotion O
to O
a O
commercial O
associate O
. O

These O
guidelines O
were O
effective O
on O
6/1/2000 O
. O

The O
conversation O
that O
you O
and O
I O
had O
was O
prior O
to O
these O
changes O
. O

Effective O
6/1/2000 O
, O
the O
Office O
of O
the O
Chairman O
has O
made O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
we O
are O
to O
adhere O
to O
these O
promotion O
guidelines O
going O
forward O
. O

Celeste I
, O
I O
am O
writing O
to O
get O
some O
clarification O
on O
how O
the O
recent O
changes O
to O
the O
program O
affect O
my O
eligibility O
for O
promotion O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
you O
informed O
me O
that O
I O
was O
not O
eligible O
for O
promotion O
to O
associate O
until O
the O
mid O
year O
review O
( O
my O
2 O
year O
anniversary O
) O
. O

It O
was O
my O
impression O
that O
the O
only O
reason O
that O
I O
was O
held O
back O
from O
promotion O
into O
the O
associate O
program O
was O
tenure O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
reading O
the O
memo O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
I O
will O
not O
be O
eligible O
for O
promotion O
to O
associate O
until O
I O
complete O
3 O
years O
in O
the O
program O
. O

I O
am O
wondering O
if O
I O
am O
still O
eligible O
for O
promotion O
to O
associate O
during O
this O
PRC O
? O

Thank O
you O
in O
advance O
for O
your O
prompt O
attention O
to O
this O
matter O
. O
